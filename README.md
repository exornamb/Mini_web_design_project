## About This Repository

This repository contains a mini web design project that I have completed with the help of online courses. It showcases the skills and concepts Iâ€™ve learned in responsive web development, including HTML5 and CSS3. The project highlights my ability to build modern, responsive layouts optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

Feel free to explore the code and see the results of my learning journey!
